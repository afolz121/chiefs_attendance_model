# chiefs_attendance_model

The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model to accurately predict A Kansas City Chiefs home game using 
data frame https://pro-football-reference.com.

The first file is chiefs_data_scrape. This is a method for scraping pro-football-reference to get statistics and attendance
data for the number of years you are looking to use.

The next file (which is in development) will be an Exploratory Data analysis excerise on the Chiefs attendance DataFrame.
